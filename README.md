Hello!

My name is Ivanna and I am a Data Scientist with a background in Engineering. 

My interest in science has been present since I was a child, which is one of the reasons I studied Chemical Engineering. A demanding and very interesting career. It helped me, and sometimes forced me, to develop logical thinking, organization techniques and team working skills. 

I had some programming classes at secondary school, but my real interest for learning more about it started in college. Simple youtube videos were the start, and once I was graduated, I took the Henry Bootcamp. This has led me to learn more about Python and SQL for database management, for example.

I am motivated by the possibility of solving real problems with these tools and others.

Technology Stack:
* Python
* MySQL
* Docker
* Streamlit

I love learning, and I hope to add a lot more tools to this stack.
